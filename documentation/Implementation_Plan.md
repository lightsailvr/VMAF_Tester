## Development Methodology

### Testing & Validation Approach
After each major feature implementation (numbered sections like 2.1, 2.2, etc.), we will:
1. **Build and run in Xcode** to verify compilation
2. **Execute comprehensive logging tests** to validate functionality
3. **Run manual testing scenarios** specific to that feature
4. **Review log output** to ensure expected behavior
5. **Fix any issues** before proceeding to the next feature
6. **Commit working code** with descriptive commit messages
7. **Push to GitHub repository** to maintain development history

### Logging Strategy
Implement comprehensive logging throughout the app using OSLog:
```swift
import OSLog

extension Logger {
    private static var subsystem = Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier!
    
    static let fileManager = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "FileManager")
    static let conversion = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "Conversion")
    static let vmafAnalysis = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "VMAFAnalysis")
    static let ui = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "UI")
    static let progress = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "Progress")
}

// Usage examples:
Logger.fileManager.info("Selected ProRes file: \(url.path)")
Logger.conversion.debug("FFmpeg conversion started with parameters: \(params)")
Logger.vmafAnalysis.error("VMAF process failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
```
